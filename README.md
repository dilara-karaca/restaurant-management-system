RESTAURANT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

About the Project

Restaurant Management System is a multi-user web-based application developed to digitally manage restaurant operations. The system integrates core restaurant processes such as order management, table tracking, menu organization, and inventory control.

The project is built using PHP and MySQL and follows a structured relational database design. It includes a role-based authorization system that provides different access levels for different user types.

#User Roles

The system includes three main user roles:

   Customer

      -View menu

      -Create orders

      -View order history

   Waiter

      -Take table-based orders

      -Update order status

      -Track active orders

   Admin

      -Manage menu and categories

      -Add, edit, and delete products

      -Monitor stock and ingredients

      -Manage personnel

      -Access reports and system controls

This role-based architecture models real-world restaurant workflow in a structured and organized manner.
